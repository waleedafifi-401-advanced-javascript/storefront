### Phase 4 Requirements
In phase 4, we will be completing work on our Virtual Store by adding a two full page views to the application: Product Details and Checkout

### User Stories

As a user, I want to see a full detail view of a product so that I can make a more informed choice about purchasing it.
As a user, I want to view my full cart and initiate the checkout process so that I can purchase my items and have them delivered


### Technical Tasks

Add routing to the application
Link every product to a page that displays the full product details
Link the “Cart” summary in the header to a full shopping cart page with shipping/payment forms
Additionally, we will be swapping out our Redux store and replacing it with a store built using Redux Toolkit
